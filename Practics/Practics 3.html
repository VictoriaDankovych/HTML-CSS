<h2>Background</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Biological and adoptive families</h3>
<p>Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble, and was adopted by Paul
    and Clara Jobs (née Hagopian).[3]

    His biological father, Abdulfattah "John" (al-)Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. 1931), grew up in Homs,
    Syria, and was born into an Arab Muslim household.[4] While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut,
    Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in prison for his political activities.[4] He pursued a PhD at the
    University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble, a Catholic of Swiss and German descent.[4][5] As a
    doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same
    age.[6] Mona Simpson, Jobs's biological sister, notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their
    daughter was dating a Muslim</p>

<h3>Birth</h3>


<div class="text">
    <div class="new"><p>Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs,
        Syria. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "without telling me,
        Joanne
        upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me."[12]
        Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was
        "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy,"[13][14] but the couple later changed their mind.[13] Jobs was then
        placed
        with Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption
        papers.[15] She then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family,[13]
        and
        only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after the couple pledged to pay for the boy's college
        education</p>

        <p>"Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near or at the top as history unfolds and we
            look back. It is the most awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly
            the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time, historically, where this invention has taken
            form." —Steve Jobs, 1995. From the documentary, Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview.[11]</p>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<hr>
<p>Paul worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist,[19] several other jobs,[20] and then "back to work as a machinist."

Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957[21] and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California.[22] It was during this time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics."[23] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad."[23] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.[24][page needed] He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner."[24][page needed]</p>

    <p>"I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics … then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do."
—Steve Jobs[18]</p>
